# To-Do List Application

This is a simple and intuitive to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. The tasks are saved in `localStorage` so that they persist across page reloads.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks by entering text and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Complete Tasks**: Click on a task to mark it as completed. Click again to unmark it.
- **Delete Tasks**: Double-click on a task to delete it, or click the 'X' button next to a task to remove it.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in `localStorage` and will persist even after the page is reloaded.
